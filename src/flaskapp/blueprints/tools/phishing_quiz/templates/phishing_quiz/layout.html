        <h1>Phishing Quiz</h1>
        <p id="description">This feature is a quiz that tests your ability to 
            identify phishing attempts in emails. You will be presented with a 
            series of emails and you have to decide whether they are legitimate 
            or not. Select the sentences in the email that you think indicate a 
            phishing attempt. If you select a sentence that is marked as a 
            "solution" you will be considered correct, otherwise you will be 
            considered wrong. As you go through the quiz, you will learn about 
            the tactics and techniques used by attackers to trick you into 
            giving away your personal information.</p>

        <form id="phi-user-info" class="hidden" name="phi-user-info" method="post" autocomplete="off" onsubmit="return false">
            <p>
                Enter a name and email (they don't have to be real).
                These are only to enhance the sense of reality and will not be used or sent outside of your device.
