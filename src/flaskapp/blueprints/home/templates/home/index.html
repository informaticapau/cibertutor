    <h1>Hello User!</h1>
    <p id="presentation">In a world where technology is becoming more and more a part of our lives, the danger
        posed by cyberthreats to which we could be exposed is growing. Knowing how to prevent and
        act against them is crucial to avoid becoming the victim of cybercriminals. Good practices and
        general knowledge on how to act in cyberspace should be more widely disseminated to the
        population, especially to those who do not have sufficient technical knowledge of Information
        and Communications Technology (ICT). This work aims to provide a tool to raise awareness
        by bringing them concepts, good practices and practical scenarios to reflect on.</p>
